Implemented simple Depth First Search with Backtracking to solve graph coloring and as an approach to improve backtracking
efficiency added few other techniques namely Most constrained variable i.e., MRV heuristic, least constraining value heuristic 
and arc consistency and implemented as DFSB++ function in the code.

Command to use: python dfsb.py <-input_file> <-mode_flag>

<-input_file>  -  graph coloring problem (sample files are attached)
<-mode_flag> - 0 for simple dfsb and 1 for dfsb++
