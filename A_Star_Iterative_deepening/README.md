Implemented A* algorithm using Manhattan distance and Misplaced tiles heuristics for 8 puzzle and 15 puzzle problem.
Implemented Iterative Deeping A8 star algorithm for 8 puzzle and 15 puzzle problem.

Commands to run: python puzzlesolver.py <#Algorithm> <N> <INPUT_FILE_PATH> <OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>
<#Algorithm>- '1' for A* output, '2' for IDA* output
<N>- '3' - for 8 puzzle problem and '4' - for 15 puzzle problem.
<INPUT_FILE_PATH> - path of the input files (attached 3.txt foor 8 puzzle and 4.txt for 15 puzzle problem)
<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH> - path to output file.
